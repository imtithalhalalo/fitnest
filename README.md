Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- For Database, the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) which is a relational database management system based on the SQL.
- This project uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) which is a framework following MVC design pattern with elegant syntax. 
- For the chat, the application uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which provides NoSQL and real-time hosting of databases. 
- For the messages, the application uses react-native-gifted-chat which is a great tool to implement chat.
